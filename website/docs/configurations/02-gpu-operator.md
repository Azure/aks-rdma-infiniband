This guide assumes a basic understanding of GPU Operator and its role in Kubernetes clusters. Readers unfamiliar with the GPU Operator are advised to review the official [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html) before proceeding. The concepts and recommended configurations presented here build on that foundation to enable RDMA over InfiniBand in AKS. This documentation is based on GPU Operator v24.9.2.
